# best
- The controller was filetuned for best performance. The best performance was achieved for following Pi values:
    Kp: 24
    Ki: 5
- For above PI values there's no steady state error and optimal settling time

- The cube's initial configuration is as follows:
    [1,0,0,1.2],
    [0,1,0,0.5],
    [0,0,1,0.025],
    [0,0,0,1]

- The cube's final configuration is as follows:
    [0,1,0,1],
    [-1,0,0,-1],
    [0,0,1,0.025],
    [0,0,0,1]

- The initial robot configuration is as follows:
    (0.1, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, -1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
