# newTask
- To test the code on new cube's pickup and goal location, new cube configurations were as follows:
    initial: x: 1.2 y: 0.5 phi: 0
    goal: x:1 y: -1 phi: -1.5707

- Kp and Ki values from best results were used:
    kp: 24 
    ki: 5

- The cube's initial configuration is as follows:
    [1,0,0,1.2],
    [0,1,0,0.5],
    [0,0,1,0.025],
    [0,0,0,1]

- The cube's final configuration is as follows:
    [0,1,0,1],
    [-1,0,0,-1],
    [0,0,1,0.025],
    [0,0,0,1]

- The initial robot configuration is as follows:
    (0.1, -0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, -1.6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
